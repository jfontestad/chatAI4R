Description: The Large Language Model (LLM) represents a groundbreaking advancement 
    in data science and programming, and also allows us to extend the world of R. 
    A seamless interface for integrating the 'OpenAI' API 
    (see <https://openai.com/blog/openai-api>), 'Stable Diffusion' and 
    other Web APIs into R is provided in this package. This package leverages LLM-based 
    AI techniques, enabling efficient knowledge discovery and data analysis.
    In addition, this package includes functionality for performing 
    image generation such as txt2img (t2i) and img2img (i2i) using the 'DALL-E 2' and 
    'Stable Diffusion' APIs.
Depends: R (>= 4.2.0)
