Description: chatAI4R provides a seamless interface for integrating 
    OpenAI and other APIs into R. It utilizes the OpenAI API 
    (see <https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference>) for natural 
    language processing using Large Language Models (LLM), making it ideal for 
    efficient data analysis and knowledge discovery. Additionally, it includes 
    functionalities for executing 
    image generation such as txt2img and img2img and other techniques,
    making it a versatile tool for a variety of research domains.
