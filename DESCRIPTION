Description: A seamless interface for integrating the 
    OpenAI API (see <https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference>) and 
    other APIs into R is provided in this package. This package leverages large language model (LLM)-based 
    AI techniques, enabling efficient knowledge discovery and data analysis.
    In addition, this package includes functionality for performing 
    image generation such as txt2img and img2img using the DALLÂ·E 2 and 
    Stable Diffusion APIs.
