Description: The Large Language Model (LLM) allows us to extend the world of R. 
    A seamless interface for integrating the OpenAI API 
    (see <https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference>) and 
    other APIs into R is provided in this package. This package leverages LLM-based 
    AI techniques, enabling efficient knowledge discovery and data analysis.
    In addition, this package includes functionality for performing 
    image generation such as txt2img (t2i) and img2img (i2i) using the DALL-E 2 and 
    Stable Diffusion APIs.
Depends: R (>= 4.2.0)
